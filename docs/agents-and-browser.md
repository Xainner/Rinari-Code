# Agent activity and the engine browser

Agents inherit the spawning session's tool catalog and permission ceiling.
This includes dynamically registered SSH, MCP and plugin tools. A child never
gets a broader permission profile than its parent. Session grants are shared;
new consent requests appear in the parent conversation with the agent's name.
Cancelling a child invalidates its pending consent request.

Explicit restrictions remain available in trusted project agent definitions:

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Inspect this repository
profile: read-only
tools:
  - fs.read
  - search.*
---
Review the requested changes and return findings.
```

Store this as `.rinari/agents/reviewer.md`. Omit `profile` and `tools` to inherit.
Role objectives, budgets, concurrency limits and cancellation still apply.
Parent-bound delegation and channel delivery closures are not copied to children.
Child processes and browser profiles have separate ownership and are closed when
the child finishes. This change does not enable recursive delegation.

In Code, expand **Ver actividad** on an agent card to inspect its objective,
effective permissions, working directory, commands, visible model messages and
result. Child activity is correlated and persisted under the parent turn and is
rebuilt when conversation history reloads. It is not private model reasoning.

The **Navegador** panel opens automatically when the active conversation has a
connected engine browser. It shows periodic captures of the exact CDP page the
agent uses, supports choosing a page and can be minimized or reopened. It is an
observation panel: manual interaction is available through **Abrir fuera**.
It does not run a duplicate iframe page or expose Tauri commands to web content.

The browser survives individual turns and closes with the session or engine.
`browser.view.get` is read-only: polling never launches or navigates a browser.
Disconnected states and capture failures are shown without claiming success.
The HTML file preview remains a separate feature for manually playing a local
game inside Code.

New capabilities: `agent_inheritance_v1`, `agent_activity_v1`, `browser_view_v1`.
Update the packaged engine and restart `npm run tauri -- dev` to load the new
Rust command and protocol. No commit or publication is included in this change.
